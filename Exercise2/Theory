An atomic operation?
  - An operation where a processor simultaneously can read and write in the same operation. This ensures that no other process reads
    or writes before the operation is complete.
A semaphore?
  - A variable used to control access, by multiple processes, to a common resource.
A mutex?
  - Ensuring that no two concurrent processes are in their critical section at the same time. Prevents race conditions.
A critical section?
  - A part of a multi-process program that may not be concurrently executed by more than one of the program's processes.
    Typically the critical section accesses a shared resource.
